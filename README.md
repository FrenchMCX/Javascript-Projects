## Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The class game of tic-tac-toe. The player starts and the computer will then respond accordingly. It features a place sound effect, a win sound effect and a tie sound effect. 

## Calculator
